# Advent of Code 2024

Most probably failing at a couple challenges from Advent Of Code 2024. Using the opportunity to learn a little Haskell to keep the brain a little alive. 

I'm not necessarily eager to be quick or even in time with the daily challenges, however, I'm trying to use a little spare time in the christmas season. 

## Building
